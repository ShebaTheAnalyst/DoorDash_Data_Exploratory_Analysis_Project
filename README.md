# DoorDash_Data_Project

The objective of this exploratory analysis is to investigate my spending patterns on the DoorDash food delivery platform between July 2019 and April 2021. By analyzing various forms of information such as time of day, item type, order size, and total dollar amount per order, I aim to understand the factors that influence my spending decisions and identify any trends that exist in the data.
